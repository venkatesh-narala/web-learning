                        Tigers are the largest species of big cat, known for their striking orange coats and black stripes. They are solitary hunters, primarily found in Asia, and are skilled swimmers. Tigers are powerful and stealthy,<br> often hunting alone in dense forests or grasslands.
                        There are several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, Sumatran tiger, and the critically endangered Indochinese and Malayan tigers. The Bengal tiger is the most populous, while the Siberian tiger, found in the cold forests of Russia, is the largest and most endangered. Tigers are apex predators, meaning they have no natural predators other than humans. Their diet consists mainly of large herbivores, such as deer, wild boar, and even buffalo. They are skilled ambush hunters, stalking their prey through the underbrush before launching a powerful, quick attack.
